# Contribution

**So...**
You wish to contribute.
Well.

## This guide will walk you through how to add to the bot (in all files)

# Setting Up

If you have not already done so, please create a [**GitHub Account**](http://github.com/join). Please make your username somewhat recognisable, e.g if you're in the Discord, make it your Discord name.

When it comes to the final page (interests etc.) you don't have to fill this in.

# Forking the Project

GitHub is good because it allows you, as a contributor, to easily "fork" projects and pull request into them (more on that later)

So, go to [PokeHub](https://github.com/Strikerrr/PokeHub) and press **Fork**. This should then redirect you to what is now **YOUR** version of the project. The URL should be something like:
> https://github.com/strikerrrr-alt/PokeHub

Locate on your repository the **assets** folder. Click on it, then depending on what command you wish to add Assets to, click on that folder. We will be adding to **info**.

# Making a file

Now inside the folder, you should see a load of files. These are important, as the naming convention is very **strict**. So, click on the **Create New File** button, and in the naming field, name it accordingly, (e.g: **001_bulbasaur.js** , **010_caterpie.js** , **100_voltorb.js** and finally, **003_mega-venusaur**). Forms of pokemon always follow that last example.

> You can see what the name looks like.

On another tab, locate the appropriate template for you. **info**'s template is just inside of the folder (infoTemplate.js)

Copy-paste this into your file you are working on. See the // bits? Those are tips. When you finish removing and replacing information, please do remove the tips.

# Tips on Making a File

Due to our strict system (not our fault >.<), we have certain rulesets you must follow. One, in particular, involves words such as "**can't**". If a word is hyphenated, you must place a **\\** **before** the hyphen (e.g **can\\'t**). This is called **escaping out** the hyphen.

The other tips needed are in the **template** file.

# Finished the File

Once you are finished with it, then you may begin the process of pushing it towards us. Scroll to the bottom of your file you are editing and you will see "**Commit New File**. Fill in however you like, but make sure you know what you added. Usually, the default message is OK to use. 

Next, click on **Commit New File** (green button).

> As you can see, there is a pre-made message ready for you. Nothing else is needed, press that DAMNED green button lol.

# Making a Pull Request

And finally, it all comes together.
The glorious
The wonderful
**Pull Request**

So, go back to your landing page on your repository. Click "**Pull Requests**, and click **New Pull Request**.

>  This is what you should see. Stay with me here, dammit, stay with me!

Click **Create Pull Request** and fill it out like below

> Greatness is steps away...

Alright! Click the final green button, and voila! 
You did it!

# Final Section (Editing, Fetching from Main, etc...)

## Editing
Okay so. You may not be done yet. It depends.
Let's say we ask you to make an edit to your PR in a review.

Go to your main page of PokeHub, find the file you made in the actual repository (providing u followed instructions when making it, it should be fine) and click the file, then click the pen to edit. Normally, we tell you what lines or even point out what needs editing, so you should be fine here. Once done, commit it and the Pull Request updates automatically. Smart, right?

## Fetching
If your branch says at this point "behind Strikerrr/master" then you need to "Pull" from my main branch. You can do this by simply going to Pull Requests, clicking on New Pull Request and then clicking Compare Between Forks. It should look something like this:

Now, once you go through the process of creating this, you go back to your landing page and you should see there is now a Pull Request within your repository. You can navigate to this and approve. Now you are fully updated!

## Final Notes

Thanks for your help if you are contributing and/or will contribute.
We appreciate you all!
